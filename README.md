Digital Edition of Fernando Pessoa. Projects and Publications
======
Webapp
======

This is the Github repository accompanying the Digital Edition of Fernando Pessoa's Projects and Publications. It contains the code of the eXist-app, which is used for the digital edition. The data of the edition (TEI files of the texts, indexes of names, titles, periodicals, timeline and network data) can be found in another repository, which is versioned separately from this one: https://github.com/cceh/pessoa-corpus

Resulting from a collaboration between researchers of the Estranging Pessoa research project, based in IELT (Institute for the Study of Literature and Tradition), New University of Lisbon, and the CCeH (Cologne Center for eHumanities), University of Cologne, the digital edition aims at offering a unique access to the documents of Fernando Pessoaâ€™s work.

The results of this work are published on http://pessoadigital.pt since 2017.
