                    <l>The latest god, whose honey-coloured hair</l>

                    <l>By which our love's eternity is willed.</l>

                    <l>Whereon to burn our brothers yet unborn.</l>
                    <l>Yet shall our presence, like eternal morn,</l>
                    <l>Ever return at Beauty's hour, and shine</l>
                    <l>Out of the East of Love, and be the shrine</l>
                    <l>Of future gods that nothing human scorn.</l>

                    <l>It rained still. But slow-treading night came in</l>
                    <l>Closing the weary eyelids of each sense.</l>
                    <l>The very consciousness of self and soul</l>
                    <l>Grew, like a landscape through dim raining, dim.</l>

                    <l>The sorrow that was still salt on his lips.</l>
                    <l>All had been something very far, a scroll</l>
                    <l>Rolled up. The things he felt were like the rim</l>
                    <l>That haloes round the moon when the night weeps.</l>

                <lg>
                    <l>His head was bowed into his arms, and they</l>
                    <l>On the low couch, foreign to his sense, lay.</l>
                    <l>His closed eyes seemed open to him and seeing</l>
                    <l>The naked floor, dark, cold, sad and unmeaning.</l>
                    <l>His hurting breath was all his sense could know.</l>

                    <l>Out of the falling darkness the wind rose</l>
                    <l>And fell. A voice swooned in the courts below.</l>
                    <l>And the Emperor slept.</l>
