                        <l>Thought was born blind, but Thought knows what is seeing.</l>
                        <l>Its careful touch, deciphering forms from shapes,</l>
                        <l>Still suggests form as aught whose proper being</l>
                        <l>Mere finding touch with erring darkness drapes.</l>
                        <l>Yet whence, except from guessed sight, does touch teach</l>
                        <l>That touch is but a close and empty sense?</l>
                        <l>How does more touch, self-uncontented, reach</l>
                        <l>For some truer sense's whole intelligence?</l>

                        <l>For this endless succession of empty hours,</l>
                        <l>Like deserts after deserts, voidly one,</l>
